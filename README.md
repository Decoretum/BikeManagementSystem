# Bisikleta Para sa Atenista

This is an application that was designed and developed by Gael Estrera (mostly by him, since he started on this way too early without groupmates yet), with the aid of his CSCI 180.05 groupmates for the final class project. This application is composed of both front-end and back-end. This application was designed and developed to be used as a Bike Management system for Ateneo de Manila University students and staff. It is composed of the following: <br><br>

<li> Order Inventory Management System with Validation </li>
<li> Admin-Side (only Admin will access system) </li>
<li> Manage appointments with students for bike repairs and services </li>
